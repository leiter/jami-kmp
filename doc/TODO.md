## UI / Live Updates

- [x] **Live cross-device own-profile avatar update** — When the user changes their avatar on another device, the change is not reflected live in the HomeScreen search bar avatar (only after app restart).
- [ ] **VCard Bitmap Scaling and Caching** — Port `VCardServiceImpl` logic from Android client to KMP. Implement disk caching of scaled avatars to improve UI performance in conversation lists.
- [ ] **Enhanced Call Handling** — Audit `CallService` against the Android implementation. Specifically look at media negotiation status events and conference participant management logic.

## Testing

- [ ] Run ViewModel tests: `./gradlew :shared:desktopTest --tests "net.jami.viewmodel.*"`
- [ ] Run integration tests: `./gradlew :shared:desktopTest --tests "net.jami.services.*IntegrationTest"`
- [ ] Run full test suite: `./gradlew :shared:desktopTest`
- [ ] Verify platform builds: `./gradlew :shared:compileKotlinDesktop :shared:compileDebugKotlinAndroid`
- [ ] Fix any failing tests from the `viewModelScope()` migration (replaced `backgroundScope` to fix `UncompletedCoroutinesError`)
